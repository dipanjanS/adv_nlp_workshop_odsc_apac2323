![](https://i.imgur.com/mXFRvUS.png)


## Abstract: 

Being specialized in domains like computer vision and natural language processing is no longer a luxury but a necessity which is expected of any data scientist in todayâ€™s fast-paced world! With a hands-on and interactive approach, we will understand essential concepts in deep transfer learning for NLP with a focus on Transformers and Large Language Models. We will compare and contrast transformers like BERT and LLMs like ChatGPT. Finally we will also showcase with hands-on tutorials how to solve popular tasks using NLP including NER, Classification, Search / Information Retrieval, Summarization, Classification, Language Translation, Q&A systems using models like BERT and ChatGPT and popular libraries like HuggingFace, OpenAI and the Python programming language.

<br/>


### Key Hands-on Examples

1. NLP Applications - Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering, Summarization, Translation, Zero-shot Classification
2. NLP Applications using Transformers and Large Language Models - ChatGPT
3. Question-Answering Search Engine Chatbots using Transformers and Large Language Models - ChatGPT
